              <p class="para"> Munnar is considered one of the most beautiful tourist places in Kerala.

The town is flanked by a narrow patch of the Arabian Sea and The Western Ghats on the other side which makes Munnar a unique getaway from the city life.

              <h2>Thiruvananthapuram</h2>
              <p class="para">Otherwise known as Trivandrum, this city is the capital and presumably the most culturally affluent part of the state. Trivandrum has played host to a variety of rulers who have all left behind a mark over the city. Rapid development has not hindered the unique heritage in the form of the architecture and the culture that is still embodied by the city. The Kowdiar Palace, which was previously the official residence of the Travancore royal family, is particularly a must-visit in the city.</p>
