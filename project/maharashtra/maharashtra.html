              <h2>Mumbai</h2>
              <p class="para">Mayanagri, the city of dreams, the one that never sleeps, India’s financial centre, Bollywood—Mumbai has many names and it lives up to each of them every day. Dotted with well-maintained architectural wonders from India’s colonial past, Mumbai offers a visual treat to Gothic architecture lovers. Meanwhile, for those who wish to experience the charm of a fast-moving city, a quick hop on the Mumbai local during the peak hours will be a story to tell. Or just embark on a 15-minute ferry ride from Gateway of India jetty to revisit a lost world at Elephanta Island. </p>

              <h2>Pune</h2>
              <p class="para">Cultural capital of Maharashtra, Pune holds a place of pride in every Marathi’s heart. Once a political centre of the Indian sub-continent, Pune was the seat of Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. The district alone boasts of 17 forts of which the most famous are Shaniwar Wada, Singhagad Fort and Purandar Fort, closely followed by a remarkably different looking Aga Khan Palace that served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi soon after he launched the Quit India movement.</p>

              <h2>Mahabaleshwar</h2>
              <p class="para"> Nestled amid the scenic Western Ghats, this popular hill station is known for its breath-taking landscapes, evergreen timberlands, waterfalls and ancient temples. A trip to Mahabaleshwar means boating in Venna Lake, undertaking a sunset trek to the Pratapgarh Fort, visiting Rajpuri Caves, tantalising your taste buds with freshly-plucked berries and clicking picture-perfect photos with astounding views of the hills and valleys in the background</p>

              <h2> Lonavala</h2>
              <p class="para">Located between Mumbai and Pune, this beautiful hill station offers a quick getaway from the rushed city life. Famous for mouth-watering chikki (Indian candy made of nuts set in jaggery or sugar syrup), Lonavala offers a scenic drive from both cities. The beautiful winding roads and long tunnels on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway is a reason enough to keep going back to Lonavala. While Lonavala itself is a very small hill station, it is surrounded by some of the best tourist places in Maharashtra such as Pawna Lake, Lohagarh Fort, Visapur Fort, Tiger’s Point, Bhaja Caves, Kune Falls and Shree Narayani Dham Temple. </p>
